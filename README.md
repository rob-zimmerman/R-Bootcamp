# R Bootcamp Materials

This repo contains the teaching materials (scripts + handouts) for two R bootcamps I ran during my PhD. The sessions are hands-on and designed to get people productive in R quickly, using end-to-end examples rather than isolated syntax drills. These materials are not an R package -— they’re meant to be opened in RStudio and run interactively.

## What's covered

Across the bootcamps, topics include (roughly):

- Core R workflow in RStudio
- Data simulation and basic data handling
- Visualization and exploratory plotting
- Logistic regression with `glm` (fitting, interpretation, prediction)
- Model evaluation and prediction workflows
- Maximum likelihood via `optim` (including practical optimization tips)
- A second set of examples covering additional modelling and tooling (e.g., regularization via `glmnet`)

The emphasis is on practical modelling: fit a model, interrogate it, make predictions, and understand what the code is doing.
